Sweetners can either by natural or artifial. No matter what the source is, some of them might might cause side effects on your body than others. In this article, we will go through some of the most commonly used sweetner additives and evaluvate their safety.

## Sugar

Well, one could argue that this is the most safest compared to all other sweetners. This however is the slightly expensive due to less (intensively) sweet - meaning, the manufacturers have to add more sugar to get the same amount of sweetness that they might be able to get with adding 1/10th the amount of some other sugar substite.

According to [this article](https://www.heart.org/en/healthy-living/healthy-eating/eat-smart/sugar/added-sugars) by the American Heart Association, the daily sugar limit for men should be less than 36 grams for men and less than 25 grams for women. 

My personal opinion is that the low added sugar you consume a day, the better. But doesn't our brain need glucose to function properly? Yes it does! and you get enough sugar for that to happen from everything else you eat, like bread, fruit and sometimes even vegetables.

Refined white sugar has a higher [glycemic index](https://glycemicindex.com/) compared to brown sugar, which is almost impossible to find sometimes. However, both of these falls to the higher, riskier side. This could put you at a higher risk of developing Diabetes Mellitus. Fruits on the other hand has a low glycemic index.

## ins950 - Acesulfame Potassium

Acesulfame Potassium or Ace-K is found almost everywhere. According to [this article](https://www.cspi.org/chemical-cuisine/acesulfame-potassium), it might also be present in breast milk in small quantities from lactating women who claim to have never consumed Ace-K.

[Research](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5464538/) done on animals say that it changes the gut microbiome (dysbiosis of the gut), sometimes in ways that might cause weight gain and inflammation. [This source](https://draxe.com/nutrition/what-is-acesulfame-potassium/) and [this research](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10445552/) suggests that  it might cause diabetes mellitus type 2 and metabolic syndrome. [This research](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2887503/) done in vitro shows that Ace-K acts directly on the pancreatic islets and potentiates glucose-induced insulin release, supporting this fact even further.

[This](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35324894/) and [this](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8946744/) observational research (NutriNet-Santé) suggests that both Ace-K and Aspartame are associated with a modestly higher overall cancer risk with a hazard ratio of around 1.13 for higher vs non‑consumers. [This](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36638072/) research from this same observational group also links to potentially higher risk of developing cardiovascular diseases.

[This research](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32360221/) tells that Ace-K lacks carcinogenicity but some articles online groups Ace-K with a lot of other sweetners and tells its carcinogenic. The evidence here seems to be pretty mixed.

[This research](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0304389424014808), also done on animals confirms that inflammatory bowel disease can be triggered by Ace-K.
[This research](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022316622022386) suggests that it's bad to be consumed during pregnancy as it might induce Glucose Intolerance and Adipose Tissue Dysfunction along with premature birth and other complications according to some [other article](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/318604).

Overall, I would avoid this as much as I can.
